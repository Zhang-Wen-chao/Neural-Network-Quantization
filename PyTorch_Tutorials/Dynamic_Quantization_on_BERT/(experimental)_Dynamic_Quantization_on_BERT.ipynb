One preliminary requirement to enable the intra-op parallelization support is to build PyTorch with the right [backend](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cpu_threading_torchscript_inference.html#build-options) such as OpenMP, Native, or TBB. You can use `torch.__config__.parallel_info()` to check the parallelization settings.
